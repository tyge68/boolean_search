# Demo File: Search Mode Comparison

This file demonstrates the difference between "Same File" and "Same Line" search modes.

## Test Case 1: Terms on Different Lines

Line with aaa only
Line with bbb only
Line with ccc only

Query: "aaa AND bbb"
- Same File Mode: ✅ MATCHES (file has both) - Shows lines 5 and 6
- Same Line Mode: ❌ NO MATCH (no line has both)

## Test Case 2: Terms on Same Line

This line has both aaa and bbb together!

Query: "aaa AND bbb"
- Same File Mode: ✅ MATCHES - Shows line 16
- Same Line Mode: ✅ MATCHES - Shows line 16

## Test Case 3: NOT Operator - Different Lines

Line with aaa here
Line with bbb here
Line with ccc here

Query: "aaa NOT ccc"
- Same File Mode: ❌ NO MATCH (file contains ccc)
- Same Line Mode: ✅ MATCHES - Shows line 23 only (has aaa, not ccc)

## Test Case 4: NOT Operator - Same Line

Line with both aaa and ccc together - should NOT match

Query: "aaa NOT ccc"
- Same File Mode: ❌ NO MATCH (file contains ccc)
- Same Line Mode: ❌ NO MATCH (line 31 has both)

## Test Case 5: Complex Query

Here is term aaa on this line
Here is term bbb on this line
Here is term ccc on this line
Here we have aaa and bbb together
Here we have aaa and bbb and ccc together

Query: "aaa AND bbb NOT ccc"
- Same File Mode: ❌ NO MATCH (file contains all three)
- Same Line Mode: ✅ MATCHES - Shows line 40 only (aaa AND bbb, but no ccc)

## Test Case 6: OR Operator

Term aaa appears here
Term bbb appears here

Query: "aaa OR bbb"
- Same File Mode: ✅ MATCHES - Shows lines 47 and 48
- Same Line Mode: ✅ MATCHES - Shows lines 47 and 48
  (OR works the same in both modes when terms are separate)

## Test Case 7: Multiple Terms Same Line

function export const myFunction = () => {}
const private function internalHelper = () => {}

Query: "function AND export"
- Same File Mode: ✅ MATCHES - Shows both lines 57 and 58
- Same Line Mode: ✅ MATCHES - Shows line 57 only

Query: "function AND private"
- Same File Mode: ✅ MATCHES - Shows both lines 57 and 58
- Same Line Mode: ✅ MATCHES - Shows line 58 only

## Summary

Same File Mode = Terms anywhere in file
Same Line Mode = Terms on the same line

Choose the mode that fits your search intent!
