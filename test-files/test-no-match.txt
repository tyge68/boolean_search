# Test File - Should NOT Match "aaa AND bbb NOT ccc"

This file contains aaa, bbb, AND ccc - so it should be excluded by NOT.

Here is aaa on this line.
Here is bbb on this line.
Here is ccc on this line - this is the excluding term!
Here are aaa, bbb, and ccc all together.

This file should match queries like:
- aaa
- bbb
- ccc
- aaa AND bbb
- aaa AND bbb AND ccc

But should NOT match:
- aaa AND bbb NOT ccc (SHOULD NOT MATCH - ccc is present!)
- aaa NOT ccc (ccc is present)
- bbb NOT ccc (ccc is present)
